# CAV Prototype Build Workflow
To setup the CAV Prototype Platform build environment you must do the following:

1. Create a Catkin workspace in a location of your choosing
`mkdir <workspace_name>`

2. Clone the CarmaPlatform repository into the `src` folder
`git clone git@github.com:fhwa-saxton/CarmaPlatform.git src`

3. Run the Catkin make procedure
`catkin_make`

The Catkin build procedure may take some time but after the completion of 3, 
your build environment should be complete.
