This version of the CARMA software is 2.7.2, released on 17 July 2018, and represents the 
first public release of the CARMA platform Prototype I.

Installation must be performed from a development computer.  Once the system is built 
locally on that computer, the remote installer tool, found in the engineering_tools 
directory, can be run to transfer the executable and configuration files to the target 
vehicle computer in a directory named /opt/CARMA.

Operating the software requires that it is installed in a properly modified Cadillac SRX, 
Ford Escape or Freightliner Cascadia truck with device drivers in place.
