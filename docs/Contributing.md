### Making Changes

#### Fork the Repository
Make a fork of our develop branch 
 * You can fork a repository on GitHub by navigating with your browser to the GitHub URL of the open-source project you would like to contribute to.
 * When you’re on the main page for the repository, you’ll see a “Fork” button on your upper right-hand side of the page, underneath your user icon:
 * Click on the fork button to start the forking process. With the repository forked, you’re ready to clone it so that you have a local working copy of the code base.
 
#### Clone the Repository
Then clone a local copy of this forked branch
* You can alternatively copy the URL by using the green “Clone or download” button from your repository page that you just forked from the original repository page. 
* Once you click the button, you’ll be able to copy the URL by clicking the binder button next to the URL:

#### Create a New Branch
The number one rule is to put each piece of work on its own branch.
