This is the first public release of the CARMA platform (internally known as Prototype I).

Installation must be performed from a development computer.  Once the system is built 
locally on that computer, the remote installer tool, found in the engineering_tools 
directory, can be run to transfer the executable and configuration files to the target 
vehicle computer in a directory named /opt/carma. Please see the User Guide in the docs
folder for more details.

Operating the software requires that it is installed in a properly modified vehicle, with
corresponding device drivers in place.  Use at FHWA Saxton Lab is on customized Cadillac SRX, 
Ford Escape and Freightliner Cascadia truck.
