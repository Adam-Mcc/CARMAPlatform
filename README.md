# CarmaPlatform
This is the second generation, reusable CARMA platform developed for FHWA under STOL II, Task Order 13.
CARMA is a reusable, extensible platform for controlling SAE level 1 connected, automated vehicles (CAVs). 
It provides a rich, generic API for third party plugins that implement vehicle guidance algorithms. It is 
written in Java and C++ and runs in a Robot Operating System (ROS) environment. It offers a rich 
application programming interface (API) for third party authors to develop guidance plugins that can plan 
vehicle trajectories under certain conditions. The platform can be reused as-is on a variety of properly 
modified vehicles, with only a need for new device drivers to connect to the vehicle hardware.
