To update or change this libasn1c.so library, please follow those steps:

Preparation:

To generate this libasn1c.so library, your workspace should have this structure:

Workspace
  |
  ------include
  |
  ------src

All generated header files from asn1c and JNI header files shoube be in include folder.

All generated source files from asn1c(except for converter-sample.c) and wrapper.c shoube be in src folder.

Build:

In Workspace, run "gcc -DASN_DISABLE_OER_SUPPORT -DPDU=MessageFrame -shared -o libasn1c.so -I./include/ -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include/linux/ ./src/*.c -fPIC".

Copy the new generated shared library in your Workspace.

Paste and replace the old libasn1c.so library in this folder.

Post Build:

Make sure to update the wrapper.c file in ../src as well.
