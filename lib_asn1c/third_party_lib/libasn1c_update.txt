To update or change this libasn1c.so library, please follow those steps:

Preparation:

To generate this libasn1c.so library, your workspace should have this structure:
(Workspace in this context is a temporary folder ouside the Carma code tree for creating the third party shared library)

Workspace
  |
  ------include
  |
  ------src

All generated header files from asn1c and JNI header files shoube be in include folder.

All generated source files from asn1c(except for converter-sample.c) and wrapper.c shoube be in src folder.

Make sure asn1c is working in your system.

For the complete list of dependencies, check https://github.com/vlm/asn1c/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md

For configurations and build steps, check https://github.com/vlm/asn1c/blob/master/INSTALL.md

To use asn1c, check https://github.com/vlm/asn1c/blob/master/doc/asn1c-usage.pdf

A stable version ticket is: 59b1bc8, which is on Sep 19th 2017.

Build:

To generate code for the usage of our platform, run "asn1c -pdu=MessageFrame -fcompound-names -gen-PER ***.asn"

Note: ***.asn here is the message spec file. We used J2735_201603.asn1 in Carma.

In Workspace, make changes on wrapper.c.

To generate the shared library, run "gcc -DASN_DISABLE_OER_SUPPORT -DPDU=MessageFrame -shared -o libasn1c.so -I./include/ -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include -I/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include/linux/ ./src/*.c -fPIC".

Copy the new generated shared library in your Workspace.

Paste and replace the old libasn1c.so library in this folder.

Post Build:

Make sure to update the wrapper.c file in ../src as well.
