# Filename: NegotiatorParams.yaml
# Creator:  Barry Reich (Barry.Reich@Leidos.com)
# Created:  2018-01-23
# Purpose:  Provide a YAML file (effectively a config file) to be associated
#           with NegotiatorMgr.java, where configuration values may be changed
#           without the need to recompile any code.

# This is currently the amount of time the Negotiator sleeps (in milliseconds)
# in between sending messages.  For now we ignore the overhead time of
# constructing messages (very minimal, and the time "in the air" where the
# message is being sent and then received from other vehicles not physically
# connected (potentially not insignificant).  We may want to subtract the air
# time from the number of milliseconds slept.
#
sleep_duration: 5000
