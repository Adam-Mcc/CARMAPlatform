	lane_change_test.launch

  A roslaunch file for helping to test the lane change plugin
  This file can be launched right after guidance has entered the engaged state
  The launch file has two arguments

  1. bag: The path to the ros bag file which will be played. It is expected this file contains the topics
  /saxton_cav/guidance/outgoing_mobility_request and /saxton_cav/guidance/outgoing_mobility_path 
  Additionally the bag file should be from the same route being tested on

  2. start_time: The start time in seconds which the bag file should begin from.
