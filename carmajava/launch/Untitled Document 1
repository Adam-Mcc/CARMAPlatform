script for launching with specific configurations

so the intended input is 
	bash script.bash <path_to_folder>

	install with configuration 

The script will take in the unique id and first see if it exists within a text file called vehicles.txt
in vehicles.txt, the unique id will be set to what existing configuration file it should be set to. This configuration will have the necessary parameters and will be run with roslaunch


If it doesn't, then the script will ask the user to input the name of the configuration file (which will have all the necessary parameters that need to be changed)

The script will then run that configuration with roslaunch
It will also save the vehicle to vehicles.txt and give it a unique id, which will be set to the configuration file that was run


scripts/carma.js
	ip address	

drivers launch
	make this file
	

saxton cav launch
	main launch file
	ip address


host vehicles params
	vehicle id
	
urdf file
	describes the transformations on the car
	coordinate frames

modify install script
to have an optional argument to the path of the configuration folder
then copy all of the files in that configuration folder to the appropriate location
